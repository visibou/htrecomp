Rebuild config/hydrothunder_functions.toml from the binary's own .pdata table.

Why this exists
---------------
The original config was produced by ExportRexGlueFunctions.java, which dumps
every function Ghidra's FunctionManager knows about as a name-only entry:

    "0x82120018" = { name = "sub_82120018" }

A name-only entry still registers the address with FunctionAuthority::CONFIG,
and ReXGlue's phase_register.cpp skips any .pdata record for an address that is
already in the graph:

    if (graph.getFunction(beginAddr) != nullptr) { continue; }   // :600

So every such entry silently discards that function's .pdata-derived size *and*
everything gated behind it: parseExceptionInfo(), setFunctionHasExceptionHandler(),
SEH try/handler scope labels, C++ ip-to-state map labels, prologue frame-size
recovery, and the marking of the 8 bytes of EH metadata that precede an EH
function as data rather than instructions.

Measured against game_data/default.xex: 14,240 of 14,258 .pdata records were
being shadowed, including 81 of 81 records with ExceptionFlag set.

The rule this script applies
----------------------------
An entry earns its place only if it tells ReXGlue something it cannot derive.

  DROP  address already present in .pdata      -> ReXGlue derives name+size+EH
  DROP  address inside a .pdata function body  -> mid-function split, corrupts
                                                  fall-through and register state
  DROP  address whose first word is zero       -> alignment padding, not code;
                                                  codegen emits an empty stub
  KEEP  address in a .pdata gap holding code   -> a function .pdata genuinely
                                                  misses (leaf, or a thunk)
  KEEP  address inside .embsec_* sections      -> not covered by .pdata at all
  KEEP  anything in --overrides                -> hand-authored, always wins

Kept entries are written WITHOUT a name. ReXGlue auto-generates sub_XXXXXXXX
(phase_register.cpp:551), which also fixes the 1,958 entries whose Ghidra-derived
lowercase name disagreed with their own uppercase address.

Output uses unquoted 0x keys to match the format the SDK's own round-trip script
(scripts/ida/export_named_funcs.py) expects.

Usage
-----
    python tools/curate_function_config.py \
        --image     ../basefile.pe \
        --old       config/hydrothunder_functions.toml.ghidra-export.bak \
        --overrides config/hydrothunder_overrides.toml \
        --out       config/hydrothunder_functions.toml

`--old` should stay pointed at the original Ghidra export, not at the generated
output, so the run is reproducible from the same input every time.

`--image` wants the flat virtual-address image produced by xextool: file offset
== VA - 0x82000000 for every section. The script verifies this before trusting
it and refuses to run if the assumption does not hold.

# A note on what precedes these addresses, since it is tempting to filter on it:
# of the 2,443 kept starts that sit in a .pdata gap, 1,217 follow zero alignment
# padding, 674 follow blr, 529 follow b/bl, 17 follow bctr/bctrl, and only 6
# follow an ordinary instruction. Filtering the last 6 out looks reasonable and
# is wrong - three of them are shared epilogues that other code branches into,
# and removing them produced unresolved-call errors from codegen. Gap addresses
# shadow no .pdata record, so there is nothing to gain by dropping them.
